The primary plots for the paper 1507.01639v2 (and v3) 
and the paper that follows (not online yet) 
come mainly from calling the following functions:

runner14_82
runner14_H1_r
runner14_H1_pi_r
runner14_weights_double_8
runner_H1_weights_pi
runner_H1_weights
run_script_2D_3
runit2D_weights_4

second paper:
runner_slab_max8_a1_6
runit14_8_ac


The other functions included in the folder are either 
called by these or are otherwise interesting. 

The folder @cell defines function for the cell class
that mimicks matrices and thereby gives an additional
dimension (or set of dimensions) to the effective array
made up of cell and array dimensions combined.

The folder Old contains many old versions and old codes
that are probably not useful (but maybe : )

The energies for the plots were found with
GS_energies2
